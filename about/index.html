<div class="center"><h1>about</h1>

<p class="abouttext">My name is Will. I'm a hobbyist developer and designer under the alias ZNTH. I am 15 living in the US, and have been improving my code and design skills for several years. In my spare time I like to play popular FPS games like PUBG or Fortnite. I used to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive competitively, and a couple seasons worth of Source a while back, before Battle Royale games were popularized. I now stream games like Playerunknown's Battlegrounds and Realm Royale.

    Now, I freelance as a developer and designer, and currently work on a few projects myself. One project I'm particularly passionate about is <a class="hyper" href="https://ubidiscordbot.github.io/">Ubi</a>, a bot I've been developing for Discord:</p>
